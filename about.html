                    <h3>Founded on Compassion and Hope</h3>
                    <p>New Beginnings Shelter System was founded in 2010 by a group of community members who recognized the growing need for comprehensive homeless services in our area. What started as a small emergency shelter has grown into a comprehensive system of support that addresses the root causes of homelessness.</p>

                    <h3>Growing to Meet Community Needs</h3>
                    <p>Over the years, we have expanded our services based on the changing needs of our community. We have added job training programs, mental health services, and permanent housing assistance to create a complete pathway from homelessness to stable housing.</p>
